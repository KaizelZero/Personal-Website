					My name is Jimmy Truong, and as you might have already read, I'm a
					Software Engineer, and a current Senior in a Computer Science Major.
					This website was made to showcase all of my projects and experience.
				</span>
				<br />
				<br />
				<span>
					I got into Computer Science because I was always on the computer as a
					kid and I wanted to learn how to make the things I was playing with.
					I've always been interested in the idea of creating something from
					nothing, and Computer Science is the perfect field for that.
				</span>
				<br />
				<br />
				<span>
					I'm currently a Senior in Computer Science at the Colorado School of
					Mines and will graduate on May 2023. After graduatation, I would like
					to go directly into the industry. I'm currently looking for a
					full-time position as a Software Engineer.
